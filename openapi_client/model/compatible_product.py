            compatibility_properties ([NameValueList]): This container consists of an array of motor vehicles that are compatible with the motor vehicle part or accessory specified by the SKU value in the call URI. Each motor vehicle is defined through a separate set of name/value pairs. In the name field, the vehicle aspect (such as 'make', 'model', 'year', 'trim', or 'engine') will be identified, and the value field will be used to identify the value of each aspect. The getCompatibilityProperties method of the Taxonomy API can be used to retrieve applicable vehicle aspect names for a specified category, and the getCompatibilityPropertyValues method of the Taxonomy API can be used to retrieve possible values for these same vehicle aspect names. Below is an example of identifying one motor vehicle using the compatibilityProperties container: &quot;compatibilityProperties&quot; : [ &nbsp;&nbsp;{ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;name&quot; : &quot;make&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;value&quot; : &quot;Subaru&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;}, &nbsp;&nbsp;{ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;name&quot; : &quot;model&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;value&quot; : &quot;GL&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;}, &nbsp;&nbsp;{ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;name&quot; : &quot;year&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;value&quot; : &quot;1983&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;}, &nbsp;&nbsp;{ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;name&quot; : &quot;trim&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;value&quot; : &quot;Base Wagon 4-Door&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;}, &nbsp;&nbsp;{ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;name&quot; : &quot;engine&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;value&quot; : &quot;1.8L Turbocharged&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;} ] Typically, the make, model, and year of the motor vehicle are always required, with the trim and engine being necessary sometimes, but it will be dependent on the part or accessory, and on the vehicle class. Note: The productFamilyProperties container is in the process of being deprecated and will no longer be supported in February of 2021, so if you are a new user of createOrReplaceProductCompatibility, you should use the compatibilityProperties container instead, and if you are already integrated and using the productFamilyProperties container, you should make plans to migrate to compatibilityProperties.

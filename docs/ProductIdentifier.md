# ProductIdentifier

This type is used to identify a motor vehicle that is compatible with the corresponding inventory item (the SKU that is passed in as part of the call URI). The motor vehicle can be identified through an eBay Product ID or a K-Type value. The gtin field (for inputting Global Trade Item Numbers) is for future use only. If a motor vehicle is found in the eBay product catalog, the motor vehicle properties (engine, make, model, trim, and year) will automatically get picked up for that motor vehicle. Note: Currently, parts compatibility is only applicable for motor vehicles, but it is possible that the Product Compatibility feature is expanded to other (non-vehicle) products in the future.
